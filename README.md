# CST8919 Lab 3 - Grafana

## Introduction
This lab successfully installed and configured Grafana on Ubuntu and integrated it with Azure Monitor using Managed Identity authentication, and visualized virtual machine performance metrics in a custom dashboard.

## Summary
1.	Installed Grafana on Ubuntu and started the service.
2.	Enabled Managed Identity Authentication in Grafana.
3.	Assigned necessary Roles (Monitoring Reader, Reader) to the VMâ€™s Managed Identity.
4.	Configured Azure Monitor as a data source in Grafana.
5.	Created a Grafana dashboard displaying key performance metrics.

## Issues Encountered and Solutions
Grafana was unable to detect resources in Azure Monitor due to missing Azure role assignments for the Managed Identity beacuse I was applying the roles incorrectly. To resolve this, the required Monitoring Reader and Reader roles were assigned properly, allowing Grafana to successfully detect resources for monitoring.
